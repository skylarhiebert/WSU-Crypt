WSU-Crypt is a block-encryption program based upon Twofish by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, and Chris Hall and SKIPJACK. The algorithm was described by Dr. Sarah Mocas as an assignment for CS427 - Computer Security at Washington State University Vancouver. 

The program accepts two inputs files, a set of text and a keyfile. This outputs either encrypted plaintext or decrypted ciphertext to stdout. 

This algorithm should be inter-operable with other algorithms of similar design, but is yet untested.

Known Compatibility: Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.3

Usage: wsu-crypt [OPTION]... [-e|-d] FILE1 FILE2
Encrypt or Decrypt FILE1 with a key of FILE2 to standard output
	Default method is encryption

	-e, -E, --encrypt	Encrypt FILE1 with key FILE2
	-d, -D, --decrypt	Decrypt FILE1 with key FILE2
	-h, -x			Output encrypted text to hexidecimal representations
	-v, --verbose, --debug	Display debug text to stdout
	--help			Display this help and exit
	--version		Output version information end exit

Examples:
	wsu-crypt -v -e plaintextfile keyfile
	wsu-crypt -d ciphertextfile keyfile
