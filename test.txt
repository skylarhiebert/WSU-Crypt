Generally, a collection of data items that can be selected by indices computed at run-time, including:
Array data structure, an arrangement of items at equally spaced addresses in computer memory
Array data type, used in a programming language to specify a variable that can be indexed
Associative array, an abstract data structure model that generalizes arrays to arbitrary indices
or various kinds of the above, such as
Bit array or bit vector
Dynamic array, allocated at run time
Parallel array of records, with each field stored as a separate array
Sparse array, with most elements omitted, to store a sparse matrix
Variable-length array
Jagged array, where the rows have different lengths individually
or various related concepts:
Array processor, a computer to process arrays of data (not to be confused with a processor array)
Array programming, using matrix algebra notation in programs (not the same as array processing)
Array slicing, the extraction of sub-arrays of an array
or also:
Global Arrays, a library for parallel processing
